Derived from the original puppetlabs-stunnel here https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stunnel. 
This version allows multiple services block that will allow multiple certificates to be run on a 
single port indirectly removing the need for running multiple stunnel instances. Please verify that 
your stunnel version supports this.

I've also remove much of the obfuscation of the parameters since I prefer them to correlate with
the stunnel parameters directly.
